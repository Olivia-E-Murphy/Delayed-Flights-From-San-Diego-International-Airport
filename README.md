# Delayed-Flights-From-San-Diego-International-Airport

Background:
In 2021, 14.5% of flights departing from San Diego International Airport offered by Southwest Airlines, American Airlines, United Airlines, and Delta Airlines were delayed. According to Statistica*, these four airlines held the largest portions of domestic market share in 2021.

Identifying leading causes of flight delays can point to areas where these airlines can improve.
