# Delayed-Flights-From-San-Diego-International-Airport

Achievement 6 of CareerFoundry's curriculum, which calls students to build an interactive dashboard in Tableau that willshowcase the results of an advanced exploratory analysis conducted in Python. 

Project Purpose
The purpose of this project is to explore the flight delays out of San Diego International Airport based on Southwest Airlines, American Airlines, United Airlines, and Delta Airlines, to discover the main causes of flight delays from 2017-2021. Identifying leading causes of flight delays can point to areas where these airlines can improve. Note, not all findings in the Python scripts were included in the Tableau dashboard.
